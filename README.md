# Kenzie Marketing Scheme

This app offers a marketing scheme where the more customers someone refers, and the more customers those customers refer, the higher the bonus the original customer receives.

For example, say that you refer ten people. Those ten people each refer another ten people. You have ten direct referrals and one hundred "second-level" referrals. If those one hundred people refer another ten people each, you have one thousand "third-level" referrals.

We need to build this scheme.
